    "\n",
    "This collection of [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks represent additional material of the masters course in Advanced Topics in Digital Communications, read by Volker Kühn, Institute of Communications Engineering, Universität Rostock. They cover basic fundamentals of digital communications as well as advanced topics related to the fields multi-user commuications and relay networks. Basic concepts of information theory are explained and illustrated by numerical examples in Python (http://ipython.org/). For detailed information about the theoretical background, we refer to the lecture slides and the recommended literature."
